        <h2>What is WingCorp?</h2>
        <p>
            WingCorp is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing">dynamically</a>
            defined 'organization'. The organization does not pursue any particular goal, nor does it adhere to any
            stipulations, dogma or activities that might serve to identify the aforementioned. Indeed, few, if any of
            its members recognize it as an organization at all.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The common thread amongst the organization is, that the members regularly engage in the field of IT,
            whether it be employment as an engineer or software developer at company or organization, researching at an
            institute of higher learning or simply exploring current technology in a set of hobby projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, most of the organization are studying, employed at or alumni of <a href="https://www.itu.dk/">The IT-University of Copenhagen</a>.
